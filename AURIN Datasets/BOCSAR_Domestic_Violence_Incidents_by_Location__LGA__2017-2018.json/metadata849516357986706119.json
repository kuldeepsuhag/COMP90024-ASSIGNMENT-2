The data has been aggregated to location following the 2018 Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) edition of the Local Government Areas (LGAs).<br/><br/>\n\nDomestic violence is a serious problem which impacts many NSW families. In 2012, an estimated 16.9 per cent of Australian women aged 18 years and over had experienced partner violence since the age of 15 years (ABS Personal Safety Survey 2012).<br/><br/>\n\nRate calculations should also be treated very cautiously for LGAs that have high visitor numbers relative to their residential population. This is because rate calculations are based on estimated residential population and no adjustment has been made for the number of people visiting each LGA per year. For the rate calculations, specialised population data were prepared and provided to BOCSAR by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).<br/><br/>\n\nFor more information please visit the <a href=\"https://www.bocsar.nsw.gov.au/Pages/bocsar_pages/Domestic-Violence.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">BOSCAR Portal</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data.</li>\n<li>LGAs which have populations less than 3000 has been suppressed to maintain confidentiality.
